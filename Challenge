#1. Using the "input" method in Python, ask a user to input a sentence. Then develop a function that accepts a the user input and will tell you how many words are in that string. First write out your plan in Pseudo-code using comments. Then craft the function. 

""" x=input('type your sentence: ')
words_list = x.split()
print(f'Word count:{(len(words_list))}')
y=(len(words_list)) """

#Let's create a function that determines if a number is odd or even

num = int(input("number"))
if (num % 2) == 0:
    print("The number is even")
else:
    print("The number is odd")
